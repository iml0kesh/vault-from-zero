# What is vault?

Vault is designed to help organizations secure, store and tightly control access to sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, certificates, and really any other critical information.

Data is accessible to those with right permission’s

It does this by encrypting secrets at rest on the storage backend of your choice.

### Additional vault features:

**_Centralized encryption and tokenization services:_** can manage all the encryption keys from one central location to ensure consistency and control over the data in the org, and tokenization is the process of replacing the sensitive data with non-sensitive data to make sure actual data never exposed.

**_Automated generation of PKI certs:_**

**_Dynamic credentials for accessing cloud platforms and databases:_** temp credentials on demand for clients and apps to access.

**_Secure injection of secrets for Kubernetes:_**
Standardized workflows for things like key management across various key management (KMS) providers: Now, whether you're using AWS, KMS, Azure Key Vault or another provider. Vault does give you a consistent interface and API, and the same process for managing all your encryption.
