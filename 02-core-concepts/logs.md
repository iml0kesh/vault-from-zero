# What are Logs?

Logs are records of events generated by applications, systems, or platforms.

They answer:

1. What happened?
2. When did it happen?
3. Who did it?
4. Was it successful or failed?

Vault generates two types of logs:

1. JSON **_audit logs_**, which capture authenticated client requests and server responses
2. Vault server logs **_(operational logs)_**, which contain operational data, plugin errors, debug dumps, and critical security events
